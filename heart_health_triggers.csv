",,,This response should only come up for the question typed there. 
age,,,"Heart risk increases with age, and especially as a women enters menopause. While younger women still can and do suffer from heart disease, the risk becomes more pronounced after age 55. ","As women age they experience more cardiovascular-related health concerns such as hypertension, high cholesterol, and weight gain. Menopause also plays a role. Before menopause, women have a natural protection from heart disease due to the presence of estrogen, a hormone that has heart-protective qualities. After menopause, estrogen levels drop, and the risk of heart disease rises.","As women grow older, other conditions that develop with age, such as diabetes, obesity, and inactivity, further increase the risk of heart disease. Thus, maintaining heart health through regular exercise, a balanced diet, and routine checkups becomes especially critical for older women.","As you age, you should be aware that symptoms of a heart attack may differ from those typically experienced by men. Women are more likely to have subtle symptoms like fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea, and jaw or back pain, rather than the classic chest pain.",
ethnicity,"cultural_background,race,black,latin, south_asian","Why does my ethnicity matter to my heart health?,Which ethnicities are more at risk?,How does my race,ethnicity affect my heart health?","Research shows that certain races and ethnicities are at higher heart risk due to either biological and/or cultural factors. 
For instance, 56% of Black women have high blood pressure and almost 46% of Hispanic women have diabetes or are prediabetic, both of which conditions have a major impact on heart health. At the same time, you are not a statistic – you're a human being with your own choices. Your MyAdesso journey will help you understand your risks and provide you with the knowledge, tools, motivations and habits to live your healthiest life and overcome these risks.","Ethnicity affects heart health due to a variety of factors, including genetics, cultural differences, socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and lifestyle choices. 

Here are a few examples of how ethnicity may interact with heart health:

Genetic Predisposition: Some ethnic groups have a higher genetic risk for certain conditions that contribute to heart disease, such as high blood pressure (hypertension), diabetes, and high cholesterol. For example, African Americans tend to have higher rates of hypertension, which increases the risk of heart disease and stroke.

Cultural and Dietary Practices: Different ethnic groups may have dietary traditions that influence heart health. Diets high in salt, fats, and sugars can contribute to risk factors like obesity, hypertension, and diabetes, all of which are linked to heart disease. For instance, certain cultural foods might be higher in sodium or unhealthy fats, increasing cardiovascular risks.

Socioeconomic Factors: Economic disparities often affect heart health. Ethnic minorities may be more likely to live in low-income areas with limited access to healthcare, nutritious foods, and safe environments for exercise. These factors contribute to higher rates of heart disease in certain communities, such as African American and Hispanic populations.

Healthcare Access and Quality: Ethnic minorities in the U.S. often face challenges in accessing quality healthcare, including preventive services, timely diagnoses, and treatments. These disparities in healthcare access can delay the identification and management of heart disease risk factors, leading to worse outcomes.

Stress and Social Determinants: Chronic stress related to experiences of discrimination, racism, and socio-economic challenges can affect heart health. Long-term exposure to stress can lead to elevated blood pressure, unhealthy coping mechanisms (e.g., smoking, poor diet), and increased inflammation, all of which are risk factors for heart disease.

Awareness and Education: Awareness of heart disease and its symptoms varies among different ethnic groups. For instance, heart disease is sometimes perceived as a ""man's disease,"" leading women in certain communities to overlook the symptoms or not prioritize their heart health.",,,
smoking,,"How does smoking affect your heart?,How many cigarettes a day are bad for your heart?","Smoking is one of the greatest risk factors for heart disease.  It is especially damaging to the lining of the arteries, the endothelium, which protects the arteries from developing plaque. On average, smokers die 10 years earlier than those who don’t.

alcohol,,"Is drinking,alcohol bad for your heart?,How many drinks are bad for your heart?","Moderation is really the key to drinking alcohol. People who reported more frequent alcohol intake showed 31.5% more stretching of the heart wall. The recommended maximum amount is one drink for women and two for men; this is moderation. And let’s be careful with what “a drink” means. For example, a pint of beer is 16 ounces. But a single drink of beer is 12 oz. So with one pint and you’re already at a drink and half. Likewise, a single drink of wine is 4  oz. A 1.5 oz. of 80-proof spirits or 1 oz. of 100-proof spirits is a single drink. And if moderation is not an option for you, abstinence may be necessary in order to curb the negative effects of drinking on your heart.",,,,
weight,,How does weight affect the heart?,"Weight Is associated with diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure, the major risk factors for heart disease. Losing weight can have a significant impact on our health. Even losing 5-10% of your body weight can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure.

This variation is called heart rate variability. Your MyAdesso journey will help you ground and refresh your heart as we provide you with the knowledge, tools, motivations and habits to live your healthiest life.",,,,
food_insecurity,,What is food insecurity?,"Food insecurity means not having access to enough food, or enough healthy, quality food to meet one's basic needs.  Not having adequate or access to quality, healthy food can contribute to heart risk. ","Food insecurity significantly increases the risk of heart disease due to its impact on nutrition, stress, and overall health. When we aren't nourishing our bodies with enough food to sustain itself or with the kinds of food that contribute to a healthy heart, this can increase our risks of heart problems. ","Here are some of the ways food insecurity affects heart health:

Poor Nutrition: Food insecurity often leads to poor dietary quality because people may rely on inexpensive, calorie-dense, but nutrient-poor foods. These foods are typically high in sodium, unhealthy fats, and added sugars, all of which contribute to obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes—key risk factors for heart disease. Limited access to fresh fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains exacerbates this issue.

Obesity: Food insecurity is paradoxically linked to higher rates of obesity, particularly in women. People who are food insecure may overeat when food is available or consume cheaper, processed foods high in fat and sugar, leading to weight gain. Obesity is a well-established risk factor for heart disease, hypertension, and other cardiovascular issues.

Increased Stress: The stress associated with food insecurity—worrying about where the next meal will come from or struggling to feed one's family—can elevate cortisol levels in the body. Chronic stress is linked to high blood pressure, inflammation, and other conditions that raise the risk of heart disease.

Impact on Chronic Conditions: Food insecurity makes it more difficult to manage chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension, which are major contributors to heart disease. For example, those with limited resources may be unable to afford healthy food options that help manage blood sugar and blood pressure or may skip meals, leading to poor blood sugar control.

Limited Healthcare Access: People experiencing food insecurity often have limited access to healthcare, which can delay diagnosis and treatment of heart disease or its risk factors. This lack of access, combined with poor nutrition, exacerbates the progression of cardiovascular diseases.

Economic Disparities: Food insecurity disproportionately affects low-income individuals and ethnic minorities, who are already at greater risk for heart disease due to socioeconomic and healthcare disparities. The inability to afford nutritious food creates a cycle of poor health outcomes that further elevates cardiovascular risk.",,

sleep_apnea,,,Sleep apnea is a sleeping disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts. It can be caused due to age and obesity.  Sleep apnea significantly increases the risk of heart disease and other cardiovascular problems.,"Here are key ways sleep apnea affects heart health:

High Blood Pressure (Hypertension): Sleep apnea can cause or worsen high blood pressure. When breathing stops during sleep, oxygen levels drop, causing the brain to signal the body to constrict blood vessels and increase heart rate. This raises blood pressure and can lead to persistent hypertension over time, which is a major risk factor for heart disease.

Increased Risk of Heart Arrhythmias: Sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of irregular heartbeats, known as arrhythmias. The repeated drops in oxygen levels can affect the heart's electrical system, leading to conditions like atrial fibrillation (AFib). AFib, in turn, increases the risk of stroke and heart failure.

Higher Risk of Heart Failure: People with sleep apnea are more likely to develop heart failure. The constant strain placed on the heart due to repeated drops in oxygen and the effort needed to restart breathing can weaken the heart over time, leading to heart failure, where the heart struggles to pump blood effectively.

Coronary Artery Disease: Sleep apnea is linked to the development of atherosclerosis, the hardening or narrowing of the arteries, which is a leading cause of coronary artery disease. Reduced oxygen levels cause inflammation and contribute to the buildup of plaque in the arteries, increasing the risk of heart attacks.

Pulmonary Hypertension: In some cases, sleep apnea can lead to pulmonary hypertension, a condition characterized by high blood pressure in the lungs’ arteries. This can strain the right side of the heart and lead to heart failure over time.

Stroke Risk: The relationship between sleep apnea and increased stroke risk is well-documented. The repeated drops in oxygen and sudden surges in blood pressure during sleep can increase the likelihood of a stroke, particularly if other heart-related conditions like AFib are present.

Poor Heart Recovery During Sleep: Normally, the heart rate and blood pressure decrease during restful sleep, allowing the heart to recover. However, in people with sleep apnea, the heart works harder throughout the night, reducing its ability to rest and recover, contributing to long-term cardiovascular damage.",Early detection and treatment of sleep apnea—such as using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices—can significantly reduce these risks and improve heart health.,,
autoimmune_disease,Systemic lupus erythematosus,,"Autoimmune diseases are conditions in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own healthy cells and tissues. This abnormal immune response leads to inflammation, which can affect various organs and systems, including the cardiovascular system. Common autoimmune diseases include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis, among others.","Autoimmune diseases can significantly increase the risk of heart disease in several ways:

Chronic Inflammation: Autoimmune diseases often cause long-term, chronic inflammation. Inflammation is a key factor in the development of atherosclerosis, which is the buildup of fatty deposits (plaque) in the arteries. This can narrow the arteries, reduce blood flow, and increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

Increased Risk of Atherosclerosis: People with autoimmune diseases are more likely to develop atherosclerosis at an earlier age than those without these conditions. The persistent inflammation associated with autoimmune diseases accelerates the process of plaque formation in the arteries, which can lead to coronary artery disease, a major cause of heart attacks.

Damage to the Heart and Blood Vessels: Autoimmune diseases can directly affect the heart and blood vessels. For instance, lupus can cause inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), the lining around the heart (pericarditis), or the blood vessels themselves (vasculitis), leading to increased cardiovascular risk. Rheumatoid arthritis can similarly affect blood vessels, increasing the likelihood of developing cardiovascular complications.

Increased Risk of Blood Clots: Some autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome, increase the risk of blood clots. Blood clots can block blood flow to the heart or brain, causing heart attacks or strokes. The risk of clotting is higher in people with autoimmune diseases due to the abnormal immune response and inflammation that can affect the clotting process.

Complications from Medications: Medications used to treat autoimmune diseases, such as corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and immunosuppressive therapies, can also contribute to heart disease risk. These medications can cause side effects like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or weight gain, which are all risk factors for heart disease.

Higher Rates of Traditional Risk Factors: People with autoimmune diseases are more likely to develop traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. The combination of autoimmune disease-related inflammation and these risk factors further increases the risk of cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes.
","Managing inflammation and traditional cardiovascular risk factors in people with autoimmune diseases to help reduce their heart disease risk. This can include creating a routine of movement, nourishing yourself through what you consume, reducing stress and building healthy relationships alongside medical treatments, prescriptions, and routines.",,

Lp(a),Lipoprotein(a),What is Lp(a)?,"Lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), is a type of cholesterol that can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. High levels of Lp(a) contribute to plaque buildup in arteries, making it a significant factor in heart risk.

To test for Lp(a), a specific blood test is required.","Lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), is tested for heart risk because elevated levels of Lp(a) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, including heart attack, stroke, and aortic valve stenosis. Unlike other forms of cholesterol, Lp(a) is largely determined by genetics and doesn’t respond well to lifestyle changes, which makes it a unique and significant marker for assessing cardiovascular risk",,,
ApoE,Apolipoprotein E,"What is ApoE?,How do you test for ApoE?","Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a protein involved in the metabolism of fats in the body. Variations in the ApoE gene can affect cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease.
